.SH "USAGE"

.LT
Markdown partial processor.

Usage: mdp [\-fvh] [\-\-color|\-\-no\-color] [\-\-debug] [\-f|\-\-force]
           [\-\-pandoc] [\-\-inspect] [\-\-pedantic|\-\-no\-pedantic]
           [\-\-toc|\-\-no\-toc] [\-v|\-\-verbose] [\-h|\-\-help] [\-\-version]
           [\-\-log\-level=<level>] [\-\-log\-file=<file>]
           [\-\-section=<1\-8>] [\-n|\-\-filename=<name>]
           [\-\-toc\-title=<title>] [\-p|\-\-print=<format>]
           [\-\-timeout=<ms>] [\-t|\-\-title=<title>]
           [\-i|\-\-input=<file...>] [\-o|\-\-output=<file...>]
           [\-w|\-\-middleware=<file...>] <args>

Options:
     \-\-[no]\-toc             Enable or disable the table of contents middleware,
                            this overrides a toc value in the meta data.
     \-\-[no]\-color           Enable or disable terminal colors.
     \-\-log\-file=[file]      Redirect to log file.
     \-\-debug                Enable debugging.
 \-f, \-\-force                Force file overwrite.
     \-\-pandoc               Include pandoc meta data.
     \-\-inspect              Enable inspect middleware.
     \-\-section=[1\-8]        Set the man page section.
 \-n, \-\-filename=[name]      Set the output file name.
     \-\-[no]\-pedantic        Enable or disable pedantic middleware.
     \-\-log\-level=[level]    Set the log level.
     \-\-toc\-title=[title]    Set the title for the table of contents, this
                            overrides the \-\-[no]\-toc flag and the toc meta data
                            property.
 \-p, \-\-print=[format]       Print document to stdout.
     \-\-timeout=[ms]         Millisecond timeout for middleware.
 \-t, \-\-title=[title]        Document title.
 \-i, \-\-input=[file...]      Meta definition file(s).
 \-o, \-\-output=[file...]     Output file(s), may be specified once for each
                            format. The output format is determined by the file
                            extension, md, txt, html, xhtml or [1\-8]. If no
                            output files are specified then README.md is
                            generated in the current directory.

                            If the output path is a directory then a file is
                            created for each supported format.
 \-v, \-\-verbose              Print more information.
 \-w, \-\-middleware=[file...] Require custom middleware.
 \-h, \-\-help                 Display this help and exit.
     \-\-version              Output version information and exit.

Examples:
 mdp \-\-force                Generate `README.md` from `package.json`,
                            overwriting the file if it already exists.
 mdp \-\-toc                  Include a table of contents.
 mdp \-\-no\-toc               Disable table of contents (overrides meta data).
 mdp \-\-toc\-title Navigation Enables the toc middleware and sets the title for
                            the table of contents.
 mdp \-\-force                Generate `README.md` with pandoc meta data
                            prepended.

.BL
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBliteral|lit\fR: A string literal.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBreference|ref\fR: A property reference.

.EL
.SS "Generator"
.PP
By default \fBmdp(1)\fR will append a \fIgenerator\fR message to the end of the document, it is nice if you wish to leave it in to help spread the word, however you may disable this message by setting the \fBgenerator\fR property to \fBfalse\fR.
.SH "MIDDLEWARE"
.PP
Middleware functions are executed asynchronously once for each token encountered in the markdown document.
.PP
Implementations are passed a \fBmeta\fR object which is the merged result of processing all the input configuration files (\fB\-\-input\fR) and should return a closure that will be invoked once for each token in the document.
.PP
The closure function \fImust\fR be a named function and should return when zero arguments are passed so that function names may be used within error messages. It is passed the arguments:
.BL
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBtoken\fR: The current token being processed.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBtokens\fR: The list of all tokens in the document, you may use \fBtokens.peek()\fR to look ahead but you should not modify the array.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBnext\fR: A callback to invoke when the token has been processed, signature is: \fBnext(err)\fR.
.EL
.PP
If you pass an error to next the program will terminate immediately, failure to invoke \fBnext()\fR will result in an error after a timeout (\fB\-\-timeout\fR) has been exceeded.
.PP
The \fBinspect\fR middleware is shown below:

.LT
function middleware(meta) {
  return function inspect(token, tokens, next) {
    if(!arguments.length) return;
    console.dir(token);
    next();
  }
}
.PP
You can enable it by declaring it in the meta data (or by using \fB\-\-inspect\fR):

.LT
{
  "middleware": [
    "inspect"
  ]
}
.SH "HOOK"
.PP
Keep your README up to date with a git hook, this is the \fBpre\-commit\fR hook from this repository:

.LT
#!/bin/sh
cd ${GIT_DIR}/.. && npm run build \
  && git add \-f README.md doc/alt/README.*
.PP
If you have \fBmdp\fR in your path you could use:

.LT
#/bin/sh
cd ${GIT_DIR}/.. mdp \-\-force && git add README.md
.SH "LICENSE"
.PP
Everything is MIT[8]. Read the license[9] if you feel inclined.
