.SH "USAGE"

.LT
Markdown partial processor.

Usage: mdp [\-vfh] [\-\-color|\-\-no\-color] [\-\-debug] [\-v|\-\-verbose]
           [\-f|\-\-force] [\-\-pandoc] [\-\-inspect]
           [\-\-pedantic|\-\-no\-pedantic] [\-\-toc|\-\-no\-toc] [\-h|\-\-help]
           [\-\-version] [\-\-log\-level=<level>] [\-\-log\-file=<file>]
           [\-\-section=<1\-8>] [\-n|\-\-filename=<name>]
           [\-\-toc\-title=<title>] [\-p|\-\-print=<format>]
           [\-\-timeout=<ms>] [\-t|\-\-title=<title>]
           [\-i|\-\-input=<file...>] [\-o|\-\-output=<file...>]
           [\-w|\-\-middleware=<file...>] <args>

Options:
     \-\-[no]\-pedantic        Enable or disable pedantic middleware.
     \-\-[no]\-color           Enable or disable terminal colors.
     \-\-log\-file=[file]      Redirect to log file.
     \-\-debug                Enable debugging.
 \-v, \-\-verbose              Print more information.
 \-f, \-\-force                Force file overwrite.
     \-\-pandoc               Include pandoc meta data.
     \-\-inspect              Enable inspect middleware.
     \-\-section=[1\-8]        Set the man page section.
 \-n, \-\-filename=[name]      Set the output file name.
     \-\-log\-level=[level]    Set the log level.
     \-\-[no]\-toc             Enable or disable the table of contents middleware,
                            this overrides a toc value in the meta data.
     \-\-toc\-title=[title]    Set the title for the table of contents, this
                            overrides \-\-no\-toc and the toc meta data property.
 \-p, \-\-print=[format]       Print document to stdout.

 \-o, \-\-output=[file...]     Output file(s), may be specified once for each
                            format. The output format is determined by the file
                            extension, md, txt, html, xhtml or [1\-8]. If no
                            output files are specified then README.md is
                            generated in the current directory. If the output
                            path is a directory then a file is created for each
                            supported format.
 \-w, \-\-middleware=[file...] Require custom middleware.
 \-h, \-\-help                 Display this help and exit.
     \-\-version              Output version information and exit.

Examples:
 mdp \-\-force                Generate README.md from package.json, overwriting
                            the file if it already exists.
 mdp \-\-toc                  Include a table of contents.
 mdp \-\-no\-toc               Disable table of contents (overrides meta data).
 mdp \-\-toc\-title Navigation Enables the toc middleware and sets the title for
                            the table of contents.
 mdp \-\-force \-\-pandoc       Generate README.md with pandoc meta data prepended.

.SS "Partial"
.PP
A partial may be one of:
.BL
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBliteral|lit\fR: A string literal.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBreference|ref\fR: A property reference.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBobject|obj\fR: A json or javascript object reference.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBinclude|inc\fR: Include a file, normally a markdown document but not necessarily.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBbinary|bin\fR: Execute a command and use \fBstdout\fR as the content.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBrequire|req\fR: Require a \fB.js\fR module or a \fB.json\fR file.
.EL
.SS "Literal"
.PP
At it's simplest a partial may be a string that contains markdown text.
.SS "Reference"
.PP
A reference to a property in the meta definition file. This is useful when you are embedding the partial definition in \fBpackage.json\fR and wish to reference the existing meta data such as \fBname\fR or \fBdescription\fR.
.SS "Object"
.PP
A reference to an object or a json object definition.
.SS "Include"
.PP
Include a file as a partial. Files are resolved relative to the \fBinclude\fR configuration directory, if the \fBinclude\fR configuration property is not set they are resolved relative to the current working directory. Typically this is a markdown document to include literally, but can also be used to wrap other files in markdown code blocks, useful for examples.
.PP
Note that when including files trailing whitespace is removed from the file contents before inclusion in the resulting document.
.BL
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBtrim\fR: A boolean that when set to \fBfalse\fR disables the default behaviour of removing trailing whitespace from the file contents.
.EL
.SS "Binary"
.PP
Execute a command and include the command's \fBstdout\fR in the resulting document. If the command prints markdown then you can use that output, otherwise you can wrap the command's output as a markdown element or just include it literally. This is particularly useful when you want to include a program's help (\fB\-\-help\fR) output as a section within a document.
.PP
Binaries inherit the environment of the parent process (\fBmdp\fR) and the current working directory. The following fields are specific to the \fBbinary\fR partial type:
.BL
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBstderr\fR: A boolean that indicates that the command \fBstderr\fR stream should be used instead of the \fBstdout\fR stream.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBcmd\fR: A directory that becomes the working directory for the child process.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBenv\fR: An object containing properties to \fIappend\fR to the environment for the child process.
.EL
.SS "Require"
.PP
Require a \fBjs\fR module or a \fBjson\fR file. Files are resolved relative to the \fBrequire\fR configuration directory, if the \fBrequire\fR configuration property is not set they are resolved relative to the current working directory.
.SS "Fields"
.PP
These are the common fields that apply to all partial types:
.BL
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBtitle\fR: Injects a markdown heading for the partial, by default this is a level 2 heading although you may adjust this with the \fBlevel\fR configuration property.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBtext\fR: Markdown text to inject after the title but before the partial content.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBtype\fR: A type that indicates how the partial content should be wrapped, eg: \fBcode\fR.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBlanguage\fR: A language to assign when wrapping as a \fBcode\fR block.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBfooter\fR: Markdown text to inject after the partial content.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBstringify\fR: When referencing javascript objects (via \fBref\fR, \fBreq\fR etc.) this indicates that the result should be converted to \fBJSON\fR using \fBJSON.stringify\fR. The stringify implementation is circular reference safe and uses two spaces as the indentation but you may modify this with the \fBindent\fR property.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBindent\fR: An integer indicating the number of spaces to indent when converting to a \fBJSON\fR string.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBformat\fR: A custom format string to use to wrap the partial result, should have a single \fB%s\fR that will be replaced with the partial content.
.EL
.SS "Generator"
.PP
By default \fBmdp(1)\fR will append a \fIgenerator\fR message to the end of the document, it is nice if you wish to leave it in to help spread the word, however you may disable this message by setting the \fBgenerator\fR property to \fBfalse\fR.
.SH "MIDDLEWARE"
.PP
Middleware functions are executed asynchronously once for each token encountered in the markdown document.
.PP
Implementations are passed a \fBmeta\fR object which is the merged result of processing all the input configuration files (\fB\-\-input\fR) and should return a closure that will be invoked once for each token in the document.
.PP
The closure function \fImust\fR be a named function and should return when zero arguments are passed so that function names may be used within error messages. It is passed the arguments:
.BL
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBtoken\fR: The current token being processed.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBtokens\fR: The list of all tokens in the document, you may use \fBtokens.peek()\fR to look ahead but you should not modify the array.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBnext\fR: A callback to invoke when the token has been processed, signature is: \fBnext(err)\fR.
.EL
.PP
If you pass an error to next the program will terminate immediately, failure to invoke \fBnext()\fR will result in an error after a timeout (\fB\-\-timeout\fR) has been exceeded.
.PP
The \fBinspect\fR middleware is shown below:

.LT
function middleware(meta) {
  return function inspect(token, tokens, next) {
    if(!arguments.length) return;
    console.dir(token);
    next();
  }
}
.PP
You can enable it by declaring it in the meta data (or by using \fB\-\-inspect\fR):

.LT
{
  "middleware": [
    "inspect"
  ]
}
.SH "HOOK"
.PP
Keep your README up to date with a git hook, this is the \fBpre\-commit\fR hook from this repository:

.LT
#!/bin/sh
cd ${GIT_DIR}/.. && npm run manual && git add \-f MANUAL.md \
  && npm run build && npm install \-g \
  && git add \-f README.md doc/alt/README.*
.PP
If you have \fBmdp\fR in your path you could use:

.LT
#/bin/sh
cd ${GIT_DIR}/.. mdp \-\-force && git add \-f README.md
.SH "LICENSE"
.PP
Everything is MIT[8]. Read the license[9] if you feel inclined.
