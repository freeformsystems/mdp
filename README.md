rdm(1)
======

Markdown partial processor.

```
npm i -g rdm
```

Designed to generate markdown documents from a series of partials. 

Read [partial](https://github.com/freeformsystems/rdm#partial) to learn how to define partials or get a quick feel by checking the [configuration](https://github.com/freeformsystems/rdm#configuration) that created this document, see [usage](https://github.com/freeformsystems/rdm#usage) for an abbreviated look at the command line options, the [manual](https://github.com/freeformsystems/rdm#manual) section is the result of generating program help for `rdm(1)` as markdown it illustrates the result of running an executable with a specific environment configuration.

Use this program to:

1. Concatenate multiple markdown documents into a single file.
2. Generate a table of contents for markdown document(s).
3. Include the output of a shell program, great for examples or program usage.
4. Keep your readme in sync with your code and prevent redundant effort with code samples.
5. Convert relative links to absolute links so your readme documents work when displayed on the [npm](http://npmjs.org) website.
6. Be pedantic in presentation, but lazy authoring. Ensure paragraphs are terminated with a period and start out title case.

This program was built using the [command](https://github.com/freeformsystems/cli-command) module:

> Command execution for command line interfaces, a component of the toolkit.

If you care for excellent documentation and write command line interfaces you should check it out.

## Features

* Synchronize your readme with your code.

## Defaults

```javascript
{
  "generator": "Generated by [rdm(1)](https://github.com/freeformsystems/rdm).",
  "title": null,
  "gfm": true,
  "period": ".",
  "pedantic": false,
  "include": null,
  "require": null,
  "branch": "master",
  "links": null,
  "toc": false,
  "order": false,
  "base": null,
  "partial": null
}
```

## Meta

Meta data describes processing options and how you want to collate the partials.

### Options

* `generator`: A boolean that disables inclusion of the generator text.
* `title`: A string that sets the document title.
* `gfm`: A boolean that indicates that [github](http://github.com) flavoured markdown is in use.
* `period`: The character used by the [pedantic middleware](https://github.com/freeformsystems/rdm#pedantic-middleware).
* `include`: A directory that is the base path for [include partials](https://github.com/freeformsystems/rdm#include-partial).
* `require`: A directory that is the base path for [require partials](https://github.com/freeformsystems/rdm#require-partial).
* `branch`: A branch name to use when resolving links that begin with `/` for [github](http://github.com), only applicable if `gfm` is set.
* `links`: The name of a links include file, resolved relative to `include`.
* `toc`: Enable the table of contents middleware with `true` or set to a string to include a title above the table of contents.
* `order`: A boolean that indicates the `toc` middleware should use ordered lists.
* `base`: Enable the absolute link middleware, specifies the base URL for absolute links.
* `partial`: Array of partial definitions, see [partial](https://github.com/freeformsystems/rdm#partial).

### Partial

A partial may be one of:

* `literal`: A string literal.
* `reference`: A property reference.
* `include`: Include a file, normally a markdown document but not necessarily.
* `binary`: Execute a command and use `stdout` as the content.
* `require`: Require a `.js` module or a `.json` file.

All keys are available using a three character abbreviation, specifiying `bin` is equivalent to `binary`.

### Generator

By default `rdm(1)` will append a *generator* message to the end of the document, it is nice if you wish to leave it in to help spread the word, however you may disable this message by setting the `generator` property to `false`.

## Middleware

Middleware functions are executed asynchronously once for each token encountered in the markdown document.

The `inspect` middleware is shown below:

```javascript
function inspect(meta) {
  return function(token, tokens, meta, next) {
    console.dir(token);
    next();
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "middleware": [
    "inspect"
  ]
}
```

## Usage

```

### Bugs

Report bugs to muji [&#x6e;&#x6f;&#111;&#112;&#x40;&#120;&#x70;&#x6d;&#46;&#x69;&#x6f;](&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#x6e;&#x6f;&#111;&#112;&#x40;&#120;&#x70;&#x6d;&#46;&#x69;&#x6f;).

## Library

Whilst designed to be used as a command line interface, in order to support ordered lists when round tripping the [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) tokens back to markdown it was necessary to extend the `Parser` and `Renderer` classes.

These are exposed via the `MarkdownParser` and `MarkdownRenderer` properties of the module.
